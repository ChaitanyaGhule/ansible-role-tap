## 4. DEPLOYMENT FLOW (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: System Prerequisites
1. **Disk Space Check**: Ensures sufficient space (>10% free)
2. **Package Installation**: Installs PHP, Node.js, Apache, required extensions
3. **Service Management**: Starts Apache and PHP-FPM
4. **Directory Creation**: Creates persistent `/opt/tap/` structure

### Phase 2: Backend Deployment (Per Market)
1. **Git Operations**: Clones/pulls latest code from Bitbucket
2. **Composer Install**: Installs PHP dependencies (with caching)
3. **Laravel Setup**: Runs artisan commands (cache, config, routes)
4. **Autoload Generation**: Ensures PHP autoloading works

### Phase 3: Frontend Deployment (Per Market)
1. **Git Operations**: Pulls latest frontend code
2. **NPM Install**: Installs Node.js dependencies (with caching)
3. **Build Process**: Compiles frontend assets
4. **Version Publishing**: Creates production symlink to version

### Phase 4: Verification
1. **Directory Checks**: Verifies all paths exist
2. **Service Status**: Confirms Apache/PHP-FPM running
3. **Application Health**: Checks autoload and version deployment
4. **Summary Report**: Provides deployment status

## 5. CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

### Key Variables (defaults/main.yml)
```yaml
# Markets to deploy
tap_markets: [pl, gr, at, cz, pt, be, es, fr, it, ch, ro, il, nord, uk, nl, tr]

# Paths (CRITICAL CHANGE: /mnt → /opt for persistence)
tap_backend_base_path: "/opt/tap/v2-markets"    # Persistent storage
tap_frontend_base_path: "/opt/tap/www"          # Persistent storage

# Performance settings
tap_node_options: "--max_old_space_size=4096"   # 4GB memory for Node.js
tap_composer_cache_dir: "/tmp/composer-cache"   # Shared cache
tap_npm_cache_dir: "/tmp/npm-cache"             # Shared cache

# Ownership (configurable for different environments)
tap_file_owner: "apache"                        # Can be changed to nginx, www-data
tap_file_group: "apache"                        # Can be changed per environment
```

## 6. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### Before vs After
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Single Market | 25-30 min | 8-12 min | 60% faster |
| All 16 Markets | 6-8 hours | 2-3 hours | 62% faster |
| Composer Time | 20 min | 2-3 min | 85% faster |

### Key Optimizations
1. **Composer Caching**: Shared cache across markets
2. **NPM Caching**: Reuses node_modules where possible
3. **Memory Allocation**: 4GB for Node.js builds
4. **Disk Cleanup**: Automatic when space low
5. **Persistent Storage**: `/opt` instead of `/mnt` prevents code loss

---

## 7. RISK MANAGEMENT & SAFETY

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Critical Operations**: Fail deployment if essential steps fail
- **Non-Critical Operations**: Continue with warnings (using `failed_when: false`)
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Git fails → copy from source, npm ci fails → npm install
- **Verification**: Post-deployment health checks

### Production Safety Features
- **Composer Lock**: Respects composer.lock for consistent dependencies
- **Version Control**: All deployments tagged with version (20240724)
- **Service Management**: Ensures web services are running
- **Ownership**: Proper file permissions for web server

### Rollback Strategy
- **Git-based**: Can revert to previous commits
- **Version Symlinks**: Easy to switch between versions
- **Backup**: Old deployments preserved
- **Service Recovery**: Automatic service restart on failure

---

## 8. MONITORING & VERIFICATION

### Built-in Health Checks
1. **Directory Structure**: Verifies all paths exist
2. **Service Status**: Confirms Apache/PHP-FPM running
3. **Application Files**: Checks autoload.php exists
4. **Version Deployment**: Confirms correct version deployed
5. **Git Status**: Verifies repository state

### Logging & Debugging
- **Ansible Logs**: Full deployment logs
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Start/end times for each operation
- **Error Messages**: Clear failure descriptions
- **Debug Output**: Detailed information for troubleshooting

---

## 9. OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Team Requirements
- **Ansible Knowledge**: Basic Ansible understanding required
- **Application Knowledge**: Understanding of Laravel/Node.js helpful
